<h1> ABOUT ME <h1>
  <h2>Hi, I'm Sophia!</h2>
  <p>
    From New York City, I am a current junior at Cornell University pursuing
    a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Information Science, on the Pre-Medicine track.
    As I adopt innovative design thinking and comprehend the intricacies of global health and medicine,
    I hope to meet the outdated aspects of health with the nuances of technology and design and provide
    a fresh perspective towards approaching medical problems.
</p>
  <p>
    I like challenges. With experience in research and laboratory work, in addition to my
    design course work, I offer an original skillset. I am not afraid to challenge what
    what is offered on the table, to pursue and advance alternate options and ideas. I love
    diverse opinions, and creative thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    I design with purpose. I plan on concentrating within the Information Science major
    on User Experience, because I believe the emphasis on the user allows for successful design.
