    <h3> Hinder: Find Your Perfect Housing Match! </h3>
    <em>Fall 2019</em>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Took Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and participated in a semester-long project
    with three other group members. </p>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p> Due to the lack of resources regarding off-campus housing options,
            many Cornell students have had very stressful and unpleasant experiences
            with the housing search process. This has resulted in dissatisfied living
            situations and unnecessary burdens on students. </p>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal is to improve the housing situation for Cornell students by
            providing resources for students who do not have housing, who cannot
            afford housing on campus, and who did poorly in the housing lottery. </p>
    <h3>Persona: Matt</h3>
        <p>Based on interviews with students who are struggling to find housing on
            Cornell campus, we developed a persona that encompasses the ideal
            user to our product. End goals for Matt: Understand available housing options,
            Settle on a living situation that maximizes productivity & has a beneficial impact on his wellbeing.</p>
