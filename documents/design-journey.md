## Milestone 1

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class. You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)
The website is meant for employers and people who I hope to have professional relationships with. I hope to showcase my interests and talents.

### Feel and Features (Milestone 1)
I hope to make a professional website that is catered towards designers and engineers. I want to create a simple, yet unique website that catches the eye of employers. I hope to showcase UX, since I am interested in opportunities in design.

### Final Content (Milestone 1)
I plan on creating a simple and sleek website that showcases my talents. Again, the design of the entire website is important for the audience since I am hoping to pick up opportunities in design and UX, as well as medicine and technology. I want to include links to different parts of the website, in which each would showcase a different side of myself. Hopefully, this will show a holistic view of me.


## Milestone 2

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Target Audience (Milestone 2)
The target audience is the employers (designers, researchers, people in technology), as well as people who are interested to see what I do and who I am. I want to showcase people who I am as a person so I can portray a holistic view of myself. For example, I hope to showcase the research and science aspect of myself because I am really interested in technology and science research and it's been a big part of my life. I also want to show my artistic skills through my portfolio, since I am an information science major who wants to study user experience. I hope to make a website that also appeals to designers because I am interested in graphic design and UX.


### Site Theme (Milestone 2)
The theme of my site would have neutral or pastel colors because I don't want to distract the audience away from the main content on the page. I want the website to exude sophistication and a high level of design (hopefully, since I am still learning). The colors I will potentially have on the website are: white, black, blue, and yellow. Again, I want to use the pastel version of these colors because I feel like those colors will hopefully reflect my personality and myself.


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
I came up with this navigation after thinking about what I had to offer to people. I want to show my employers my past research and experience, which includes projects that I had  worked on in the past. Because I do a lot of in my free time and in school, I also wanted to showcase that on the website. Usually on Linkedin or on a resume, I am unable to do so, but that's the beauty of a website. I also added an "About Me" because I wanted to describe myself more in depth. In terms of design, I want a navigation strip to be under the title "My name is Sophia Zhang." This will be easy for the audience to use, since I also don't have many other pages.

### Organization (Milestone 2)
I came to this organization and content mainly through my Linkedin account and my resume. I wanted to showcase my talents but more formally through all these pages. Again, I chose this content because I wanted to showcase both my professional and academic side, as well as my hobby (art). I As I continue to work on the website, I will organize it better and add more pages (if necessary).

## Milestone 3

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Changes from Milestone 2 (Milestone 3)
From milestone 2, I added content in the portfolio page and resized all my images so that they were easier to be viewed by the audience. I edited the font, colors, and sizing of all the text because I wanted to make the website more attractive to the eye. I also changed the navigation page from a list of bullet points to just a line of navigation options. Again, I wanted to make the website more pleasing to the eye and user friendly.

### Visual Design (Milestone 3)
Visually, I wanted to design a page that fit my personality. I wanted very muted/pastel colors, as well as colors that would go well with the pictures that I put on the website. I chose light blue because that color is a nice, calm shade that would relax the user but also portray my chill personality. I chose light pink because it contrasted well with the first photo on the Home page. I also chose it because it was a color that brought warmth and love. Though I chose the colors mainly based on how they looked on the website, I also believe that they represent my personality as someone who is easygoing and simple. I feel like the strength to the visual design is that they are simple and do not distract the user from the content on the page. However, I feel like a weakness to the website is that it doesn't portray my skills as a web designer, especially if I want to impress future employers. My photos may also not be very professional, but I'm working on that! Hopefully I can portray a creative side, as well as a professional one. The font was also important and I wanted a font that was simple and clean (although there are very limited options).

### Emotion (Milestone 3)
I wanted to portray my personality, which is easygoing and calm. I wanted something simple, not complex. The colors I chose are very muted and pastel, which again, hopefully portray this easygoing personality. I also chose pictures that would hopefully fit into background color.

## Final Submission - Rationale

This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section run several paragraphs (1-3). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during user testing and how you addressed them. Quotes from your users during testing are also very powerful when explaining your rationale.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier rationales.

### Changes from Milestone 3 (Final Submission)
From milestone 3, I edited the navigation bar, the layout of everything (header, paragraph, body, photos), and dded more content. During testing, a user mentioned that the navigation bar was too small and difficult to find, so I changed the layout of the bar. I also added flexbox to help tie the website together. I made these changes because I wanted to create a more polished website that reflected my vision for the website. I changed the style of the website using the new css code that I had learned. I also removed the Resume page because I realized that everything on my resume is basically on the website and since I decided to enlarge my audience intentions, I decided that it made more sense for me not to have the resume. I added more content to make the website more complete. 

### Audience (Final Submission)
The website is intended for employers and people who are interested in my portfolio and my work. Originally, I had wanted to create a website for my employers but as I continued to design and choose the content, I realized that I wanted to create a website that showcased my work to a wider audience, including anyone who is interested in my work (whether that is my projects or portfolio). I often prided myself in being an artist as well as a woman in STEM, but had no where to showcase both sides. This website allows me to showcase all my creative sides, which will hopefully attract all different kinds of audiences.

### Design Goals (Final Submission)
I aimed to create a minimalistic website with not too much going on all the pages. Each page gives a brief overview of what I specifically did. Nothing is overcrowding each other because I intended to create a very simple website. I previously mentioned that I wanted to create a professional website intended for employers; however, I realized that I just wanted to create a website that reflected who I am as a person, holistically. Because of this, the design of the website became softer and livelier.

### Navigation (Final Submission)
I wanted a navigation bar on the top of the website so that it was user friendly. I wanted to make the navigation bar visible for the audience to see, which is why it is encased in a thin-bordered white box. The navigation bar is to help the audience navigate to different pages that showcase my talents. It met my goals of being a user friendly and accessible navigation bar.

### Organization (Final Submission)
I organized the website based on the different aspects of myself and what I wanted to portray to the audience at large. For example, I wanted to showcase the projects that I had been working on, so I organized it onto a page and divided the page up into current and past projects. This is helpful for me to organize the projects I have worked on in chronological order, as well as show the audience the progression of my work. I included the most useful information - What, When, Where. This way, the audience can easily skim the information if need be. I also added a portfolio of my art work and separated that section into the painting and the sketches. This again, is easier for me and the audience to differentiate the types of work that I've done.

### Visual Design (Final Submission)
Visually, I wanted to design a page that fit my personality. I wanted very muted/pastel colors, as well as colors that would go well with the pictures that I put on the website. I chose light blue because the color is a calm shade that would relax the user but also portray my relatively easy-going personality. Though I chose the colors mainly based on how they looked on the website, I also believe that they represent my personality as someone who is easygoing and simple. I feel like visual design is very important to attract audiences. I specifically chose a very simple design with muted colors because I felt like it described me as a person. I wanted a minimalistic design so that it did not distract the suer from the content on the pages. The font was also important and I wanted a font that was simple and clean. I do not want to overload the audience with a very complex design so I created a more minimalistic visual design, with very muted/pastel colors.
